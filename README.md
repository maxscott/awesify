Do you like music?
Are you awesome?

====
Quickly and easily create music from the console, and play it in the background of any task, ever. Imagine the excitement in your peers, parents, and pets when they kick off your latest long-running task and they are greeted with tunes like:

- Mario Brothers
- Megaman Selection Screen
- Link's Death Music (from Zelda 1)
- *Whitney Houston's "I Will Always Love You"

Exactly, they'll be pumped.

*Not included, but I will write it in if you ask me to.

DISCLAIMER: 
This music is not polyphonic
Cannot play multiple songs at a time (yet...)
