Awesify.net
===========

Do you write .NET applications?
Do you like music?
Are you awesome?

If you answered 'yes' to any of these questions, you should probably start using Awesify.NET.

Quickly and easily create music from the console, and play it in the background of any task, ever. Imagine the excitement your peers, parents, and pets will feel when they kick off your latest ETL processer and they are greeted with tunes like:

- Mario Brothers
- Megaman Selection Screen
- Link's Death Music (from Zelda 1)
- *Whitney Houston's "I Will Always Love You"

Exactly, they'll be pumped. They'll wish the job took longer because they'll be digging the beats so hard.

*Not included, but I will write it in if you ask me to.

DISCLAIMER: 
This music is not polyphonic
Don't run two songs at once
It will set your motherboard on fire
I'm not good with cancellation tokens so... yeah.
